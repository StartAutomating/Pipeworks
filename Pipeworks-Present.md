This will include a number of phases:

* A Culling of Old Code (#7)

Let the past die.  Kill it if you have to.

** We Are Here **

* The Rain Of Progress

Take some more technical load of of Pipeworks by using additional technologies.

Make Pipeworks more capable and extensible.

* Rise from the Ashes

Be able to deploy a new site and service.

* If you can't beat em, join em.

Make Pipeworks the best way to work with any type of web framework.
