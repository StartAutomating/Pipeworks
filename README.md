Pipeworks is a framework for building and deploying sites and services with PowerShell and [PipeScript](https://github.com/StartAutomating/PipeScript).

Pipeworks provides functions for frontend and backend development, and lets you build custom deployments with blueprints.

Using Pipeworks, any PowerShell module or directory can easily become a site or service.

## Pipeworks's Past

Pipeworks was created in 2011 as one of the first PowerShell web frameworks.

It's goal is reducing the time and effort required to turn any PowerShell module into Software as a Service.

As there were few options available at the time, this required the creation of a quite frankly ludicrous amount of direct hosting of PowerShell and, thus, templating of other languages.
